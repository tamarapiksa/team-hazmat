Usage:

HazMap aims at helping people identify the highest instance of damage caused by hazmat incidents in the United States.

By cross-referencing the type of substance released during a given hazmat incident (explosive, flammable, etc.) with the cost per unit of the substance, we were able to determine the total monetary damages caused by hazmat incidents all over the country.
