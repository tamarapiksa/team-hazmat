Usage:

HazMap aims at helping people identify the highest instance of damage caused by hazmat incidents in the United States.

Using maching learning, HazMap predicts future hazmat incidents at city level by cross-referencing the type of substance released during a given hazmat incident (explosive, flammable, etc.), type of freight transport, quantity of substance released, total capacity of the container, and total worth of the container.

The future data on HazMap has been learned from the current provided hazmat incident data (see Data Sources). Our analysis determines whether future incidents can be explained by the most common factors present in past incidents.
